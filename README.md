# Jellyfin-for-Tizen-Compiling-Script
This is a little script for compiling Jellyfin Client for Tizen TVs on Windows

Considerations:
---------------

This script is mainly to ease the compilation of Jellyfin for Tizen on Windows computers.

~~I'm currently using Jellyfin-Web from branch 10.8.z as the main branch won't work properly.~~

There are 2 flavours:

* Jellyfin Client compiled from Jellyfin-Web using stable 10.8.3 source.

* Jellyfin Client compiled from Jellyfin-Web master repo, which should be soon 10.9 version (Maybe April 2024)

Everything gathered inside the script has been extracted from the main Jellyfin-Tizen's Github. Please check it out as this script could become obsolete soon.
